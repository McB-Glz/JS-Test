out.

// Original input

[</br>
 [1, 2, 3],</br>
 [4, 0, 6],</br>
 [7, 8, 9]</br>
]


// Result

[</br>
 [1, 0, 3],</br>
 [0, 0, 0],</br>
 [7, 0, 9]</br>
]


2. Write a function that convert the given number into a Roman Numeral - The function needs to receive a Number and
Return a String (The Number can be between 1 and 3999)

Example:

getRomanNumeral(512);

Prints: DXII


3. Write a function to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters; e.g "aabcccccaaa"
would become "a2b1c5a3" . If the compressed string would not become smaller than the original string, just print the
original string.
